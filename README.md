# Python Microservice Example

This repository is an example of how to write microservices in other languages and import them in Clio. Once the remote call specification is complete, libraries for different languages will be provided by the Clio team and community.

## How to run the example

You should first run the Python microservice server using

```
python microservices.py
```

Please note this is a Python 3 example. You can then run the client file:

```
clio run client.clio
```
